## Bio

I’m a PhD student at the University of Michigan, studying the impacts of climate change. My research draws from a broad range of disciplines, reflecting my diverse academic background. I began my journey as an undergraduate trained in hydrology, with a research focus on climate and meteorology. Later, I joined a quantitative ecology group, where I deepened my understanding of ecological systems and statistical methods.

I enjoy connecting my research with everyday life. I’m a passionate observer of nature and often use observation apps to enhance my experiences outdoors. I’m especially interested in integrating these observations into my scientific work. I also love watching science channels and drawing inspiration from creative ideas across different fields. I appreciate unconventional thinking and enjoy exploring bold, “crazy” ideas.
