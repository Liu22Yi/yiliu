    "text": "Prepare for deployment on AWS App Runner\nTo host a Shiny app on AWS App Runner, you need to have an AWS account with access to ECR and App Runner services. Set up an AWS account if necessary.\n\nPrepare a Docker file\nWe need a Dockerfile to build the Docker image of the Shiny app. Here is my example of a Dockerfile.\n# Use a base image with R and Shiny Server pre-installed\nFROM rocker/shiny-verse:latest\n\n# Install system libraries for geospatial analysis\nRUN apt-get update \\\n  && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \\\n    libudunits2-dev \\\n    libgdal-dev \\\n    libgeos-dev \\\n    libproj-dev \\\n    libmysqlclient-dev\n\n# Install R packages\nRUN R -e \"install.packages(c('shinyjs', 'shinyscreenshot', 'geosphere', 'raster', 'gstat', 'ggpubr', 'gridExtra', 'maps', 'rnpn','leaflet', 'terra','colorRamps', 'lubridate','digest','aws.s3','ptw','doSNOW','svglite','ggnewscale'), dependencies=TRUE)\"\n\n# Copy your Shiny app directory into the image\nCOPY &lt;app name&gt; /srv/shiny-server/&lt;app name&gt;\n\n# Expose the default Shiny Server port\nEXPOSE 3838\nWe can store this file at the root directory.\n\n\nConfigure AWS ECR\nWe then set up an image repository in AWS ECR to store the Docker image of the Shiny app.\n\nGo to the AWS Management Console and log in.\nSearch for Elastic Container Registry service and click Create repository. This is a private repository by default.\nSet the image repository name and click Create repository. The container image URI should be in the format of &lt;AWS account number&gt;.dkr.ecr.&lt;AWS region&gt;.amazonaws.com/&lt;image repository name&gt;:latest.\n\n\n\nConfigure AWS App Runner\nWe then set up a service in AWS App Runner that will run the Docker image of the Shiny app.\n\nGo to the AWS Management Console and log in.\nSearch for AWS App Runner service and click Create service.\nChoose Container registry as the repository type. Choose Amazon ECR as the provider. Set the container image URI by choosing the image repository name. Choose Manual for the deployment trigger. (This is because I want to keep my app paused most of the time and only resume and deploy as needed.) Choose using existing service role of AppRunnerECRAccessRole. Click Next.\nSet the service name, CPU and memory. Expose Port 3838 as this is what the Shiny app uses. Customize other configurations as needed. Click Next.\nReview the settings and click Create and deploy. Note that the service ARN is in the form of arn:aws:apprunner:&lt;AWS region&gt;:&lt;AWS account number&gt;:service/&lt;app name&gt;/&lt;resource ID&gt;. Also note the default domain name of the service in the form of &lt;service ID&gt;.&lt;AWS region&gt;.awsapprunner.com.\n\n\n\nConfigure IAM role\nAs we are using GitHub Actions, we need to set up an IAM role that allows GitHub to assume a role for deploying to AWS services. Follow the steps below to set up the IAM role. reference\n\nGo to the AWS Management Console and log in.\nSearch for IAM service and go to the IAM dashboard.\nNavigate to Access management and Identity providers.\nIf there is not an identity provider called token.actions.githubusercontent.com, click on Add provider to create a new identity provider. For Provider type, choose OpenID Connect. For Provider URL, enter the URL of the GitHub OIDC IdP for this solution: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com. For Audience, enter sts.amazonaws.com. This will allow the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) API to be called by this IdP. Add tag optionally. Click on Add provider.\nNavigate to Access management and Roles. Click on Create role. Choose Web identity as the trusted entity type. Select token.actions.githubusercontent.com as the identity provider. Choose sts.amazonaws.com as the audience. Enter GitHub organization, GitHub repository, and GitHub branch that match the app we intend to deploy.\nAdd the necessary permission policies to the role. For ECR and App Runner, you can use the AWSAppRunnerFullAccess, AWSAppRunnerServicePolicyForECRAccess, and AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess policies. Click on Next.\nName the role and edit the trust policy. Here is my example.\n\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Principal\": {\n                \"Federated\": \"arn:aws:iam::&lt;aws account number&gt;:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com\"\n            },\n            \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\",\n            \"Condition\": {\n                \"StringEquals\": {\n                    \"token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud\": \"sts.amazonaws.com\",\n                    \"token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub\": \"repo:&lt;GitHub organization&gt;/&lt;GitHub repository&gt;:ref:refs/heads/&lt;GitHub branch&gt;\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nReview the role and click on Create role.\nView the role and copy the ARN of the role.\n\n\n\nSetting up GitHub secrets\nWe need to store the ARN of the IAM role in GitHub Secrets. You will need the GitHub secret AWS_ROLE_ARN.\nTo add secrets to your repository: 1. Go to the repository’s Settings. 2. Navigate to Secrets. 3. Click on New repository secret and add the relevant keys."

It is important to be able to set up a working environment that can be accessed easily from most places. I recommend using cloud computing and cloud storage. * Cloud computing * At UofM, there is Great Lakes HPC Cluster. Check my documentation prepared for Zhu Lab for usage. There are limits on rates and quota. * AWS EC2 instances are fairly popular and easy to use. Recommend. You have full control over your instance. Not free, but we can apply for research credit. * Microsoft Azure VMs are similar to EC2. * Google Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service. Free. Good for machine learning tasks. * Cyverse funded by NSF is an Open Science Workspace. They host lots of workshops. * Cloud storage * At UofM, there is Turbo. Check my documentation prepared for Zhu Lab for usage.

We want to keep the deprecated work but we don’t want to make our working directory too cluttered. We want to be able to retrieve previous work and understand what we were doing. * Documentation * Always write comments for your code. * Write metadata. For example, use the EML template for ecological data. * Name your functions and objects informatively. Here is what I do. * Key functions are named in the fashion of action_object_suffix. Types of actions can be: down, tidy, read, calc, plot, test, summ. Objects are the object of the action, such as “climate,” or “plant”. Suffix represent the level of subsetting or a variation, such as “individual.” There can be multiple suffix. * Key R objects are named in the fashion of prefix_class_object_suffix. Types of classes can be: dat, v, ras, df, gg. Prefix “ls” means list. Object and suffix similar to above. * Write project meeting notes, perhaps in Google docs. They now have a shortcut to generate headings for meeting notes. Type @meeting notes and choose the meeting you are taking notes for. * Version control * GitHub is strongly recommended. See my previous blog for a quick start. * Use different branches for different stages of the project. Here is what we recommend. * An “analysis” branch for preliminary analysis. This branch may be messy. * A “manuscript” branch to reproduce all analyses used in the manuscript during the submission stage. Code should be tidy, preferably made into package form in this branch.

Code should be a subset of the ones in the \"manuscript\" branch, put into package. Small data files should be included in the package. There should not be dependency on external data folders.

    "text": "Abstract\nMany terrestrial plant communities, especially forests, have been shown to lag in response to rapid climate change. Grassland communities may respond more quickly to novel climates, as they consist mostly of short-lived species, which are directly exposed to macroclimate change. Here we report the rapid response of grassland communities to climate change in the California Floristic Province. We estimated 349 vascular plant species’ climate niches from 829,337 occurrence records, compiled 15 long-term community composition datasets from 12 observational studies and three global change experiments, and analyzed community compositional shifts in the climate niche space. We show that communities experienced significant shifts toward species associated with warmer and drier locations at rates of 0.0216 ± 0.00592 ℃ yr–1(mean ± std. err.) and –3.04 ± 0.742 mm yr–1, and these changes occurred at a pace similar to climate warming and drying. These directional shifts were consistent across observations and experiments. Our findings contrast with the lagged responses observed in communities dominated by long-lived plants and suggest greater biodiversity changes than expected in the near future."

    "text": "Abstract\nClimate change is causing trees to start growing earlier in the spring, but it’s not clear if this leads to more growth overall. This matters for how much carbon forests can store and which tree species will dominate in the future. Our study looked at how warming and reduced rainfall affect the timing, duration, and amount of spring growth in temperate and boreal forest trees, using data from a long-term global change experiment. We found that higher temperatures make trees leaf out and grow shoots earlier, but different species have different responses when it comes to how long this growth lasts and how much growth they can have in one spring. Reduced rainfall generally slowed down growth. Our results challenge the idea that climate change will boost tree growth, suggesting a possible limit to forests’ ability to absorb carbon dioxide. Also, the combination of warming and drying might change which species are more competitive, favoring those that can better adapt to these conditions."

    "text": "Abstract\nAirborne pollen triggers allergic reactions, which can have public health consequences. Accurate airborne pollen concentration modeling and prediction rely on understanding plant reproductive phenology, particularly the timing of flowering and pollen release. Flowering and pollen phenology data are often collected through ground observations and air sampling, but such in-situ data collection efforts are expensive and spatially sparse. In contrast to in-situ data collection, satellite-based estimates of plant phenology could potentially enable large-scale data collection, but it is challenging to detect the reproductive phenology of wind-pollinated flowers from space. Here, we infer the reproductive phenology of wind-pollinated plants on the individual tree level and city level using PlanetScope time series with a spatial resolution of 3 m and a daily revisit cycle. We complemented PlanetScope data by in-situ flower and pollen observations at the two scales, leveraging the correlation between vegetative and reproductive phenology. On the individual tree level, we extracted PlanetScope-derived green-up time and validated its correlation to flowering time using flower observations in a national-scale observatory network. Scaling up to the city level, we developed a novel approach to characterize pollen phenology from PlanetScope-derived vegetative phenology, by optimizing two tuning parameters: the threshold of green-up or green-down and the time lag between green-up/down and flowering. We applied this method to seven cities in the US and 14 key wind-pollinated tree genera, calibrated by measurements of airborne pollen concentrations. Our method characterized pollen phenology accurately, not only in-sample (Spearman correlation: 0.751, nRMSE: 13.5% for Quercus spp.) but also out-of-sample (Spearman correlation: 0.691, nRMSE: 14.5% for Quercus spp.). Using the calibrated model, we further mapped the pollen phenology landscape within cities, showing intra-urban heterogeneity. Using high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing, our novel approach enables us to infer the flowering and pollen phenology of wind-pollinated plant taxa on a large scale and a fine resolution, including areas with limited prior in-situ flower and pollen observations. The use of PlanetScope time series therefore holds promise for developing process-based pollen models and targeted public health strategies to mitigate the impact of allergenic pollen exposure."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nContext Climate change is driving phenological shifts across landscapes, but uncoordinated shifts might cause a potential “phenological mismatch.” There has been little consensus on the existence and magnitude of such a mismatch. The lack of agreement among studies can be attributed to the wide variety of definitions for the term “phenological mismatch,” as well as the methods used to measure it. The lack of comparability among measures of phenological mismatch creates a challenge for conservation.\nObjectives We proposed a novel theoretical framework to generalize existing measures of phenological mismatch and an approach to quantify the decoupling between phenology and the environment using the loss in predictive skill over time. We aimed to estimate the magnitude of phenological mismatch on large spatial scales and test the proposed predictive approach’s ability to detect multiple types of phenological mismatch.\nMethods We modeled historical climate-phenology coupling and quantified phenological mismatch as the deviation between observed and predicted phenology under climate change. First, we used two large empirical spatiotemporal datasets to estimate phenological mismatch in plant flowering phenology in the eastern United States and bird reproductive phenology in Finland. Historical climate-phenology coupling was modeled with spatial linear regression. Second, we conducted four simulation experiments representing different types of mismatch during climate change. We recovered simulated phenological mismatch by fitting a data-driven nonlinear model (Gaussian Process Empirical Dynamic Modeling) and predicting phenology.\nResults In the eastern US, we found that advancing plant flowering phenology generally matched spring warming from 1895 to 2015, with seven out of the 19 species studied having significant phenological mismatches, with observed flowering time earlier than predictions even considering warming. A similar phenological mismatch was found in birds in Finland from 1975 to 2017, with the bird breeding season advancing more than expected in 21 out of the 36 species studied. In four simulation experiments, we were able to accurately recover the simulated phenological mismatches in the timing of events, pace of development, and intensity of activities, although with greater challenges in quantifying a mismatch in life history.\nConclusions Overall, these case studies show that our prediction-based measure effectively quantifies multiple types of phenological mismatch, providing a more generalizable and comparable measure of phenological mismatch across study systems and scales. This study will enable the investigation of phenological mismatch at large scales, improving understanding of the patterns and consequences of climate-change-induced phenological changes."

    "text": "Abstract\nPhenological shifts due to climate change have been extensively studied in plants and animals, yet the responses of fungal spores—crucial organisms that play important roles in ecosystems and act as airborne allergens—remain understudied. This knowledge gap in global change biology hinders our understanding of its ecological and public health implications. To bridge this gap, we first acquired a long-term (2003 — 2022), and large-scale (the continental US) dataset of airborne fungal spores collected by the US National Allergy Bureau. We then extracted ten metrics describing the phenology (e.g., start and end of season) and intensity (e.g., peak concentration and integral) of fungal spore seasons using both ecological and public health approaches, defined as percentiles of total spore concentration and allergenic thresholds of spore concentration, respectively. Using linear mixed effects models, we quantified annual temporal shifts in these metrics across the continental US. We revealed that the onset of the spore season has significantly advanced from both ecological (11 days, 95% confidence interval: 0.4 — 23 days) and public health (22 days, 6 — 38 days) perspectives over two decades. Nevertheless, the total spore concentration in an annual cycle and in a spore allergy season tended to decrease over time. The earlier start of the spore season was significantly correlated with climatic variables, such as warmer temperatures and altered precipitations. Overall, our findings suggest possible climate-driven advanced fungal spore seasons, highlighting the importance of climate change mitigation and adaptation in public health decision-making."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nDifferent aspects of ecological systems, biotic or abiotic, often fluctuate in coordinated patterns over space and time. Such high concordance between ecological processes is often referred to as ecological synchrony. Anthropogenic activities, including and beyond climate change, have the potential to alter ecological synchrony by disrupting or enhancing existing synchrony. Despite many local studies, we have a limited systematic understanding of how ecological synchrony is shaped by management in human-dominated landscapes at regional to continental scales. From a macrosystems perspective, we review how anthropogenic activities, particularly beyond climate change, alter ecological synchrony across levels of ecological organization, from the ecosystem level to the population level. For each level, we use a large-scale case study to demonstrate ways to quantify the impacts of human modifications on synchrony using big data from remote sensing, surveys, and observatory networks. For example, we detected possible homogenization of population dynamics of bird species in North America. These changes in ecological synchrony, although in different forms, often represent challenges to ecological and social systems. Collaborative research efforts that integrate emerging open data streams moving forward will be able to provide insights into the effects of different anthropogenic drivers and the consequences of changes in synchrony."

    "text": "Abstract\nClimate change is generally changing the timing and intensity of pollen seasons, thereby often increasing human exposure to allergenic pollen. Climate-driven changes in pollen seasons present a unique opportunity to craft messaging aimed at communicating climate change impacts on public health through changes in the biological systems. However, it is unclear how pollen seasons are experienced and understood by the public, including how well we detect pollen seasons or what factors we view as responsible for changes in pollen seasons. Here, we use social media data in the United States from 2012 to 2022 to assess public perceptions of pollen seasons at large spatiotemporal scales. We show that pollen seasons detected by social media (Twitter) users align well with natural pollen seasons. Attribution of changing pollen seasons, however, varies based on political ideology: liberal users, compared to conservative users, are more likely to attribute changing pollen seasons to climate change. Mass media and scientific experts play a key role in communicating how climate change drives changing pollen seasons. Our findings reveal how changes in biological systems, political ideology, and scientific communications collectively shape public perceptions of pollen seasons under climate change. Our findings constitute a step towards more effective climate change impact communication and public health intervention design."

    "text": "Abstract\nCoastal upwelling supplies nutrients supporting primary production while also adding the toxic trace metal mercury (Hg) to the mixed layer of the ocean. This could be a concern for human and environmental health if it results in the enhanced bioaccumulation of monomethylmercury (MMHg). Here, we explore how upwelling influences Hg cycling in the California Current System (CCS) biome through particle scavenging and sea-air exchange. We collected suspended and sinking particle samples from a coastal upwelled water parcel and an offshore non-upwelled water parcel and observed higher total particulate Hg and sinking flux in the upwelling region compared to open ocean. To further investigate the full dynamics of Hg cycling, we modeled Hg inventories and fluxes in the upper ocean under upwelling and non-upwelling scenarios. The model simulations confirmed and quantified that upwelling enhances sinking fluxes of Hg by 41% through elevated primary production. Such an enhanced sinking flux of Hg is biogeochemically important to understand in upwelling regions, as it increases the delivery of Hg to the deep ocean where net conversion to MMHg may take place."

    "text": "Abstract\nMany species are responding to global warming by shifting their distributions upslope to higher elevations, but the observed rates of shifts vary considerably among studies. Here, we test the hypothesis that this variation is in part explained by latitude, with tropical species being particularly responsive to warming temperatures. We analyze two independent empirical datasets—shifts in species’ elevational ranges, and changes in composition of forest inventory tree plots. Tropical species are tracking rising temperatures 2.1–2.4 times (range shift dataset) and 10 times (tree plot dataset) better than their temperate counterparts. Models predict that for a 100 m upslope shift in temperature isotherm, species at the equator have shifted their elevational ranges 93–96 m upslope, while species at 45° latitude have shifted only 37–42 m upslope. For tree plots, models predict that a 1°C increase in temperature leads to an increase in community temperature index (CTI), a metric of the average temperature optima of tree species within a plot, of 0.56°C at the equator but no change in CTI at 45° latitude (–0.033°C). This latitudinal gradient in temperature tracking suggests that tropical montane communities may be on an “escalator to extinction” as global temperatures continue to rise."

    "text": "Abstract\nPlants track changing climate partly by shifting their phenology, the timing of recurring biological events. It is unknown whether these observed phenological shifts are sufficient to keep pace with rapid climate changes. Phenological mismatch, or the desynchronization between the timing of critical phenological events, has long been hypothesized but rarely quantified on a large scale. It is even less clear how human activities have contributed to this emergent phenological mismatch. In this study, we used remote sensing observations to systematically evaluate how plant phenological shifts have kept pace with warming trends at the continental scale. In particular, we developed a metric of spatial mismatch that connects empirical spatiotemporal data to ecological theory using the “velocity of change” approach. In northern mid-to high-latitude regions (between 30–70°N) over the last three decades (1981–2014), we found evidence of a widespread mismatch between land surface phenology and climate where isolines of phenology lag behind or move in the opposite direction to the isolines of climate. These mismatches were more pronounced in human-dominated landscapes, suggesting a relationship between human activities and the desynchronization of phenology dynamics with climate variations. Results were corroborated with independent ground observations that indicate the mismatch of spring phenology increases with human population density for several plant species. This study reveals the possibility that not even some of the foremost responses in vegetation activity match the pace of recent warming. This systematic analysis of climate-phenology mismatch has important implications for the sustainable management of vegetation in human-dominated landscapes under climate change."

    "text": "Abstract\nMacrophytes are widely recognized for improving water quality and stabilizing the desirable clear-water state in lakes. The positive effects of macrophytes on water quality have been noted to be weaker in the (sub)tropics compared to those of temperate regions. We conducted a global meta-analysis using 47 studies that met our set criteria to assess the overall effects of macrophytes on water quality (measured by phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration, total nitrogen concentration, total phosphorus concentration, Secchi depth and the trophic state index) and to investigate how these effects correlate with latitude using meta-regressions. We also examined if the effects of macrophytes on lake-water quality differ with growth form and study design in (sub)tropical and temperate areas by grouping the data and then comparing the effect sizes. We found that macrophytes significantly reduced phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration, total nitrogen concentration, total phosphorus concentration, as well as the trophic state index, but they did not have a significant overall effect on Secchi depth. The effects of macrophytes on reducing phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration, total nitrogen concentration and the trophic state index did not differ with latitude. However, the reduction of total phosphorus concentration was greater at lower latitudes. We showed that at lower latitudes, the positive effects of macrophytes on water quality are similar to or greater than those at higher latitudes, thus challenging the prevailing paradigm of macrophytes being less effective at enhancing lake-water quality in the (sub)tropics. Furthermore, our data showed that the macrophyte effects vary by growth forms, and the growth forms that positively affect water quality differ between the (sub)tropical and temperate areas. We showed a lack of significant macrophyte effects in surveys within and outside macrophyte stands, suggesting difference in the sensitivities of study designs or possibly weaker effects of macrophytes in lakes compared to experimental settings."

Next time, you can directly pull from remote repo.\n\ngit pull\n\nIf you have multiple contributors to this repo, or if you use multiple computers, you might not pull changes in time and run into conflicts. A common scenario is that you push but get a fatal error. You need to pull at this point. If there is no conflict, you can write a commit message for merging the remote and local repo, and push again. Sometimes there are conflicts. The files with conflicts will be changed, with some lines looking like this.\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nold code\n=======\nnew code\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [branch name]\n\nYou have to manually edit the files, add, commit, and push again."

After you pull your repo, you can switch between projects using\n\ngit checkout [another branch]\n\nYou can make changes, add, commit, and push as usual.\nWhen your branch is working well, you can merge your branch into another branch, perhaps the main.\n\ngit checkout [main branch]\ngit pull\ngit merge [your branch]\n\nYou might have to resolve conflicts at this point. After this, add, commit, and push.\nIf you do not work very closely as a team or would like a bit more independence, you can also fork your own copy of a repo. You can work with the fork in the same way as an independent repo, but you can “Sync” with the parent repo or “Contribute” to the parent repo."
