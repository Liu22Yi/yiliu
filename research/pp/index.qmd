[Project](https://seas.umich.edu/globalchangebiology/research/climate-airborne-pollen) founded by IGCB.

### Use LSTM and transformer to predict pollen concentration in short term

We are trying to use machine learning models for short-term pollen prediction.

### Understand pollen interannual prodcution variation for long term prediction

Pollen production has significant inter-annual variation. We are trying to identify the pattern and the environmental cues for better long term prediction.

### Using satellite observations to advance airborne pollen mapping
We developed a machine learning framework based on satellite and ground lidar observation to map pollen concentrations at the continental scale.
