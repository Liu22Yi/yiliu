## Highlights

- **We identified macrophyte species for restoration of tropical reservoirs.**
- **All six species reduced cyanobacteria and increased cryptomonads at high density.**
- **_Ludwigia adscendens_ and _Persicaria barbata_ reduced chlorophyll _a_ concentrations.**
- **Effective densities were found to be above 0.40 dry weight g/L.**
