## Highlights

- **We participated in a community forecast challenge to predict daily plant greenness with our model GPEDM out of 18 models.**
- **Forecasts across teams showed that historical means of greenness on each day of year were difficult to outperform.**
- **GPEDM had the best performance among similar models that are data-driven, dynamic (includes previous state), and use covariates.**
- **For the study sites, several static models or models without covariates had better performances than GPEDM in predicting greenness values.**
- **GPEDM showed its advantage in accurately predicting the ecologically important greenup transition dates.**

## Our model

![Gaussian Process time-delay embedding model with a spatial covaraince function layer and a temporal covariance function layer [Sugihara et al., 2012](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1227079)](3.png)

## Example of forecasts

> "For the 15 %, 50 %, and 85 % greenup transition dates, PEG, GPEDM, and greenbears_gams beat the DOY Mean model furthest out"
