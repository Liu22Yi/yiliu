## Highlights

- **We developed a method to quantify the differences in the sensitivity of plant phenology to temperature over space and over time, taking the uncertainty of both estimates into consideration.**
- **We compared spatial and temporal sensitivities in multiple wind-pollinated species to evaluate the use of space-for-time substitution in forecasting their phenology over time.**
