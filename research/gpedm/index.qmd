## Highlights

- **We used a novel data-driven method of Gaussian Process Empirical Dynamic Modeling (GPEDM) to forecast forest and grassland vegetative phenology.**
- **This nonparametric model accounts for nonlinear relationships with environmental variables and past phenology, outperforming traditional parametric methods.**
- **The model allowed us to fill in historical data, forecast future data, infer drivers, estimate green-up dates, and simulate impacts of climate change.**
- **This approach has the promise to improve predictions of phenology and understanding of complex environmental responses.**

## Inference
