## Highlights

- **The USA-NPN hosts the largest volunteer-contributed plant phenology dataset in the US.**
- **Winter-spring temperatures predicted the flowering time of oak trees.**
- **Predicted peak flowering was strongly correlated with peak airborne pollen concentrations.**
- **The USA-NPN dataset has significant potential for improving source-based models of airborne pollen.**
