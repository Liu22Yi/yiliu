## Highlights

- **The USA-NPN’s flower and pollen cone observations could address gaps in pollen monitoring.**
- **Significant correlations were found between volunteer-contributed observations and airborne pollen concentrations for 15 common tree taxa.**
- **A formal observation campaign could further enhance the quantity and utility of these data.**
