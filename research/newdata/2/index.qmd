## Highlights
- **We reviewed data collection and research at the intersection of biodiversity, instrumentation, and machine learning at NEON sites.**
- **We surveyed methods that have been developed at other locations but could potentially be employed at NEON sites.**
- **We elaborated on five fruitful future paths for automated biodiversity measurement at NEON sites.**
- **I mainly contributed to discussing the path of expanded remote and ground-based measurements for plant biodiversity.**
