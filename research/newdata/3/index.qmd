## Highlights
- **[Park et al., 2023](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.18893) used a large herbarium dataset to examine the interaction between urbanization and plant reproductive phenology.**
- **Herbarium data offer unmatched long-term, global-scale records for studying phenological shifts, proving compelling evidence of climate change impacts.**
- **We highlight new methods that are unlocking the potential of herbarium data, including advancements in digitization, machine learning, and crowd-sourcing.**
- **We identified open questions that might be answered by herbarium data, on phenological mismatch, functional traits, and evolution.**
