## Highlights

-   [**Pugh et al., 2019**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1810512116) **utilized a new global database of forest age to inform a vegetation model.**
-   **Regrowth forests constitute a carbon sink that is even greater than that of old-growth forests.**
-   **This study underscored the importance of forest age data and demographic processes in terrestrial biosphere modeling.**
-   **They challenged the traditional equilibrium view and revealed that much of the current global forest carbon sink is transient.**
-   **In light of their estimate of a smaller carbon sink than previously anticipated, even more immediate action on CO~2~ emission reduction may be justified.**
