### Flowering sensitivity

We investigated the relationship between temperature changes and flowering time in wind-pollinated trees using herbarium records, applying a phylogenetic mixed-effects model.

**Liu, Y.**, Song, Y. and Zhu, K. Plasticity instead of adaptation dominated wind-pollinated treesâ€™ flowering time sensitivity to temperature. in preparation.

### Leaf-flower sequence

We analyzed paired, individual-level data on flowering and leaf-out times to establish their relationship using circular statistics and leveraged satellite-derived green-up dates to estimate flowering time.

### Flower synchrony
Flowering synchrony, the extent to which individuals within a population flower at the same time, is a key driver of pollination efficiency and reproductive success in wind-pollinated trees. Here we are trying to use site-level flowering time data from National Phenology Network (NPN).
