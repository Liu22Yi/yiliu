### Data discontinuities in wind measurement
We reported the discontinuities in wind data in China reasoned from anemometer changes, site relocations and processing methods.

### Spatiotemporal changes of frequency of terrestrial wind speed
We quantified the influence of frequency changes in average surface wind speed changes and revealed that the weakening of strong wind was the main cause of global ‘stilling’ and the slight winds are major parts of the surface wind speed reversal.

### Decline of seasonal wind speed range over Land
Global seasonal wind speed range (SWSR), which is the difference between maximum and minimum monthly mean wind speeds (MWS), has declined over the past four decades (1980–2018), although global annual wind speeds have fallen and then increased over this period.
