## Highlights

- **This is a contribution to a worldwide collaborative study about structural uncertainty in species distribution models (SDMs).**  
- **We predicted the distributions of the species _Prionailurus bengalensis_ and _Zamia Prasina_.**  
- **We adopted an ensemble approach that averages predictions from four decision tree-based classifiers: Random Forests, Extra Trees, XGBoost, and LightGBM.**

## Data collection

We retrieved species occurrence data from [GBIF](https://doi.org/10.15468/dd.vxc7bu) and environmental predictors from [CHELSA](https://chelsa-climate.org/).

## Decision tree-based classifiers

Our method was adapted from [Daniel Furman's tutorial](https://daniel-furman.github.io/Python-species-distribution-modeling/) on species distribution modeling with python. We implemented regularization for each classifier.
