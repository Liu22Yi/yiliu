## Highlights

-   **We validate and expand plant-pollinator interaction networks with citizen science data (iNaturalist images).**
-   **We process images with interacting plant and pollinators using text-promptable image segmentation and identify species with computer vision models like Pl\@ntNet.**
-   **We compare phenology of interacting species inferred from museum specimens and identify pairs with high risks of phenological mismatch under climate change.**
