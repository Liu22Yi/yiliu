## Highlights

- **We predicted the time of budburst of red oak across NEON sites with four process-based phenological models and a linear regression model.**
- **Process-based models demonstrated higher in-sample and out-of-sample accuracy in short-term predictions.**
- **Inferred parameters in process-based models had significant correlation, suggesting parameter identifiability issues.**
