### Thermal cue for shark emigration
Work done in Bayesian Ecological & Environmental Statistics (B.E.E.S.) lab at University of Toronto.

We analyzed acoustic telemetry tracking and high-resolution water temperature data to identify and quantify a thermal threshold for mass emigration of juvenile white sharks
