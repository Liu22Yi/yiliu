## Highlights

-   **We aimed to deliver near-term forecasts of vegetative and reproductive phenology of wind-pollinated plants that induce allergy.**
-   **We leveraged diverse phenology data including remote sensing, phenophase observations, and airborne pollen concentrations.**
-   **We used spatiotemporal Gaussian Process Empirical Dynamic Modeling (GPEDM) to forecast maps of phenology in the continental US.**
-   **We implemented infrastructure to deliver forecasts every day for the following 35 days on our web app, PhenoForecast.**
